# Car-Accident-Analysis #
Automation of Car Accident dataset analysis with Airflow, Elastic Search and Kibana

## Background :  ##
Car Accident are common in United Kingdom,the financial cost associated with car accidents is also huge. The causes of accidents can be attributed to several factors, knowing how these factors influecing accidents is a key to predicting and preventing potential accidents in the future

## Objectives :  ##
This Project aims to analyze the factors causing the accident and aimed to improving road safety, transportation experts can use the insights to develop strategies to reduce the frequency and severity of car accident

## Methodology :  ##
- Data Preparation with dataset obtained from Kaggle. 
- Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Performed NoSQL Query.
- Performed Great Validation.
- Perfomered Data analysis and Visualization to analyze car accident factors.
- Produce insights to reduce the accident rates.

## Tools :  ##
Programming Language: Python Libraries: Python, Pandas, PostgreSQL, Docker, ElasticSearch, Kibana

## Results :  ##
The analysis resulted in some insights for road improvement to minimize the severity and frequency of car accident
